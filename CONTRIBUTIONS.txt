Subreg - Contributions
======================

Pull requests to add new features of fix bugs in SubReg are welcome.
For them to be accepted, it is asked that they follow a few simple rules:

1. SubReg is designed for use on systems with minimal memory resources
   available. As such, SubReg may not use any dynamic memory allocation,
   and memory allocated on the stack must be kept to a minimum.

2. SubReg is fully re-entrant. As such, it may not depend on any writable
   statically allocated memory. Large statically allocated const data
   should be avoided.
   
3. Whilst there is no formal coding style defined, try to keep
   contributions looking asthetically similar to the existing code.

4. Minimal memory use is considered more important than execution speed,
   so bear this in mind when designing any contributions to SubReg.
